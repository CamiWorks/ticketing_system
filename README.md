# Ticketing System

This project was one of the many I did for Ops. It was a small script, easily executable and deployable. It is meant to increase productivity while creating tickets without errors.

# How to use?

Access the repository file and click on the *index.html*. After that, you can change the JavaScript file to use it in accordance with your project as well. Pretty easy, pretty straightforward.
